# Kunal's Guide to Antigravity & Frontend Development

## 🚀 Welcome @kunaaalll!

You are the lead contributor for the **Frontend Dashboard** of the ShapeShifter project. This guide will help you get set up with the Antigravity IDE and start fixing issues.

## 🛠️ Your Toolkit

### 1. Antigravity IDE
You should be using the **Antigravity IDE** for all development. It provides:
- **Integrated Terminal**: For running commands.
- **Smart Editor**: With Python and JS/TS support.
- **Git Integration**: For seamless version control.

### 2. Your Mission
You are responsible for the **Frontend Dashboard** (React/Next.js).
- **Repo**: `karan100010/shapeshifter`
- **Your Issues**: Look for the `frontend` label or issues assigned to `@kunaaalll`.
- **Main Issue**: "Frontend Dashboard Implementation"

### 2. Install Dependencies

## 🐛 How to Fix Issues

### Step 1: Pick an Issue
- Go to [Issues](https://github.com/karan100010/shapeshifter/issues).
- Find one assigned to you (`@kunaaalll`).
- Read the requirements carefully.

### Step 2: Create a Branch
Always work in my branch named as Dizzycommits
```bash
# Format: dizzycommits
git checkout -b dizzycommits

### Step 3: Code & Test
- Write your code in `src/frontend/`.
- Run the dev server to test: `npm run dev`.
- **Debug**: Use `console.log` or browser DevTools.

### Step 4: Push & PR
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added dashboard sidebar (fixes #42)"
git push origin dizzycommits
```
- Go to GitHub and create a **Pull Request**.
- Tag `@karan100010` for review.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Permissions Error?** Ensure you accepted the repo invitation.
- **Can't push?** Make sure you are using the correct branch (don't push to `main` directly).
- **Env vars missing?** Ask Karan for the `.env` file or check `SETUP_GUIDE.md`.
